## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-adview.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd youtube-adview
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To start the Streamlit application, run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default browser. You can then explore the different features and functionalities provided by the application.

## Data

The dataset used in this project contains information about YouTube ads, including various features such as ad length, ad topic, ad format, ad platform, and the number of views. The data is stored in the `data` directory.

## Features

The application provides the following features:

- Data Summary: Displays a summary of the dataset, including descriptive statistics and data visualization.
- Ad Explorer: Allows users to explore the ads based on different features, such as ad length, topic, format, and platform.
- Ad Predictor: Predicts the number of views for a given ad based on its features.

## Models

The application utilizes a machine learning model trained on the dataset to predict the number of views for an ad. The model is trained using a regression algorithm to estimate the view count.

## Results

The results of the prediction model are displayed in the application, allowing users to compare the predicted view count with the actual view count.

## Future Improvements

Here are some potential improvements for the project:

- Include more advanced visualization options.
- Explore and integrate other machine learning models for prediction.
- Enhance the user interface for a better user experience.
- Incorporate additional datasets to improve prediction accuracy.

Contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome!
